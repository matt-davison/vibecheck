# vibecheck

checks the vibe

## ?

Vibecheck is a webapp that takes a user's query and searches the web for relevant content. This content is categorized (into Public, News, and Financial) and sentiment analysis is performed on the content to provide the user with an analysis of what the internet thinks about their query - in each category. This webapp was designed to help remind users that there are many different perspectives from which we can look at the world.

## Installing

You just need Python(3) and an internet connection.
We use conda, but you can install these reqs without it.
With conda just move to the project's root dir and use "conda env create -f environment.yml"
